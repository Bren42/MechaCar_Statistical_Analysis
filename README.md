# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to determine any insights that could be found regarding the production of the MechaCar prototype.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

We need to look at what items within our data might be impacting, or have impacts on the MPG of the car. 
To do this we looked at six different variables in our data:

1. Vehicle Weight
2. Spoiler Angle
3. Ground Clearance
4. AWD
5. Vehicle Length
6. MPG

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Based on the linear regression summary in the second image we can see that
